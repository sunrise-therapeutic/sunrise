GIVING THAT CREATES A LASTING IMPACT  
Donating Publicly Traded Securities & Legacy Gifts to  
Sunrise Therapeutic Riding & Learning Centre  
A powerful way to give  today and for generations to come  
Donating Securities “In Kind” (Instead of Cash)  
Gifts of publicly traded securities, including stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs: offer one of the most tax-ef ﬁcient ways to support 
Sunrise’s programs.  
• When securities are donated directly to Sunrise, capital gains tax is eliminated
• You receive a charitable tax receipt for the full fair market value on the date of transfer
• This often allows you to give more to Sunrise at the same personal cost compared to donating cash
• Particularly well-suited for donors holding appreciated investments they no longer need or wish to rebalance
Why Many Donors Choose Stock Gifts Over Cash  
• Cash donation: Capital gains may be triggered if investments are sold ﬁrst
• Securities donation: No capital gains tax — more of your gift goes directly to Sunrise ’s programs
• Especially effective during year-end planning or when gains are being realized elsewhere in a portfolio
THE POWER OF LEGACY & ENDOWMENT GIVING  
Legacy giving creates an enduring impact, ensuring Sunrise ’s mission continues to change lives well into the future.  
Including Sunrise in Your Will  
A charitable bequest allows you to support Sunrise without affecting your lifestyle today.  
• You retain full control of your assets during your lifetime
• Your estate receives a charitable tax credit, which can help offset estate taxes
• A meaningful way to leave a lasting legacy while supporting Sunrise ’s mission
Endowment Gifts: Supporting Sunrise Forever  
• Endowment gifts are invested, with income used to fund programs year after year
• Provides long-term ﬁnancial stability and funding certainty
• Ensures your generosity continues to make an impact for generations
