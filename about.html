            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Since 1982, Sunrise Therapeutic Riding &amp; Learning Centre has provided a program of therapy,
                recreation, sport and life skills training for children and adults with special needs. The program
                focuses on individual ability by providing an environment of challenge, enjoyment and achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are located on a beautiful 102‑acre farm in Puslinch, Ontario, between Guelph and Cambridge,
                and only minutes from Highway 401. In addition to therapeutic riding lessons, which are taught by
                Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association (CanTRA) certified instructors, Sunrise offers inclusive
                programs open to individuals with and without special needs.
            </p>
