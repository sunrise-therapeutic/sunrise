        <h1>Donating Securities &amp; Legacy Gifts</h1>

        <h2>Donating Publicly Traded Securities &amp; Legacy Gifts to Sunrise</h2>
        <p>A powerful way to give today and for generations to come.</p>

        <h3>Donating Securities “In Kind” (Instead of Cash)</h3>
        <p>Gifts of publicly traded securities—including stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs—offer one of the most tax-efficient ways to support Sunrise’s programs.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When securities are donated directly to Sunrise, capital gains tax is eliminated.</li>
            <li>You receive a charitable tax receipt for the full fair market value on the date of transfer.</li>
            <li>This often allows you to give more to Sunrise at the same personal cost compared to donating cash.</li>
            <li>Particularly well-suited for donors holding appreciated investments they no longer need or wish to rebalance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Many Donors Choose Stock Gifts Over Cash</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cash donation:</strong> Capital gains may be triggered if investments are sold first.</li>
            <li><strong>Securities donation:</strong> No capital gains tax — more of your gift goes directly to Sunrise’s programs.</li>
            <li>Especially effective during year-end planning or when gains are being realized elsewhere in a portfolio.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Power of Legacy &amp; Endowment Giving</h3>
        <p>Legacy giving creates an enduring impact, ensuring Sunrise’s mission continues to change lives well into the future.</p>

        <h4>Including Sunrise in Your Will</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>You retain full control of your assets during your lifetime.</li>
            <li>Your estate receives a charitable tax credit, which can help offset estate taxes.</li>
            <li>A meaningful way to leave a lasting legacy while supporting Sunrise’s mission.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Endowment Gifts: Supporting Sunrise Forever</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Endowment gifts are invested, with income used to fund programs year after year.</li>
            <li>Provides long-term financial stability and funding certainty.</li>
            <li>Ensures your generosity continues to make an impact for generations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Donors Choose Legacy Gifts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Aligns charitable intentions with estate and tax planning.</li>
            <li>Creates multi-generational impact.</li>
            <li>Can be designated to specific programs or areas of care.</li>
            <li>A deeply meaningful way to tell your story through giving.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Get Started</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Speak with your financial advisor or estate planner about donating securities or including Sunrise in your will.</li>
            <li>Sunrise can work directly with your advisor to ensure the process is simple and seamless.</li>
            <li>Every gift — present or future — helps transform lives through Sunrise’s therapeutic programs and life-skills training.</li>
            <li>Gifts may be designated to operational or capital programs, according to donor preference.</li>
