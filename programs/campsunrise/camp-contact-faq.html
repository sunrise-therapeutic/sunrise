                    My child needs medication while at camp, what is the protocol? 
                </summary>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                    If your camper requires medication while at Sunrise, whether prescription, over the counter medication or medication in emergency situations, a medical dispensing form must be filled out on or before or on the first day your camper comes to camp. Sunrise staff cannot administer any medication without the medical dispensing form filled out or if the medication is not in a properly labelled container. All medications are stored according to Ontario Camp Association standards in a secure location.

                Parents must send lunches and snacks with their campers to Sunrise. Sunrise is a peanut and nut-free facility. Peanut butter substitutes, such as wow butter, must be properly labelled or they will be disposed of. Water coolers are placed throughout our facility to ensure campers stay well-hydrated while at camp.
