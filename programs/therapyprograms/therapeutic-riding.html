                <h2 class="text-large">Sunrise Therapeutic Riding Program</h2>
                <p class="text-medium">Who this Program Serves</p>
                <p class="text-medium-small">Our Therapeutic Riding program is designed for individuals aged 3 & up with physical and/or cognitive special needs, including (but not limited to) those with autism, ADHD, developmental delays, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, visual impairments or hearing impairments.</p>
    
                <h2 class="text-large">Benefits of Therapeutic Riding</h2>
                <ul class="text-medium-small">
                    <li>Development of muscle strength and flexibility</li>
                    <li>Improvement of balance and coordination</li>
                    <li>Mobilization of trunk and pelvis</li>
                    <li>Improved learning skills and concentration</li>
                    <li>Access to social integration</li>
                    <li>A sense of achievement and independence</li>
                    <li>Increased self-esteem and self-confidence</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2 class="text-large">Admission Procedures</h2>
                <p class="text-medium-small">The following forms must be completed and submitted to Sunrise by mail, fax, e-mail or dropped off in person. Please contact Camilla Giffen, Head Instructor with any questions regarding the admission procedure (contact information below).</p>
    
                <p class="text-medium-small"><strong>Please note:</strong> All contraindications to riding are listed on the first pages of the Physician Referral form. Please look over the contraindications carefully before completing the forms.</p>
    
                <ul class="text-medium-small">
                    <li>Physician Referral and Individual Profile (please note: the Physician Referral is not necessary for unmounted programs)</li>
                    <li>R-10: Degree of Bodily Contact and Photo Release</li>
                    <li>Liability Waiver (Sunrise has a $5 million dollar liability insurance)</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p class="text-medium-small">Once the forms are fully completed and returned to Sunrise, we will contact you to set up an assessment with our Physiotherapist, Occupational Therapist and/or Speech and Language Pathologist to ensure the suitability of the program for each individual. The needs of the prospective rider will determine which consultant is present at the assessment. The assessment takes approximately 1 hour and involves a discussion regarding goals, history, abilities and needs, followed by a 15–20 minute mounted assessment for the prospective rider.</p>
    
                <p class="text-medium-small">Using the information from the assessment, and the rider's availability, we will do our best to place the rider into an appropriate lesson.</p>
    
                <p class="text-medium-small">Sunrise has an ongoing wait list so the assessment appointment could take a few months. Riding spaces are also limited, especially at popular times such as Saturdays and weekday evenings.</p>
    
                <h2 class="text-large">Lesson Schedule</h2>
                <p class="text-medium-small">Sunrise offers two sessions per year: Fall (September to December) and Winter/Spring (January to June). Lessons run weekly for 30-60 minutes depending on the number of riders in the lesson. There are scheduled Break Weeks throughout the year during which time there are no classes.</p>

CanTRA member centres are inspected regularly to ensure a high level of safety standards. CanTRA member centres purchase liability insurance through CanTRA to provide adequate coverage and ensure national standards of safety.
