        <h1>Scholarships</h1>
        <p>Sunrise programs embrace inclusion. We believe every child should experience companionship, fun, 
            a healthy lifestyle and acceptance by peers and the community, and that finances should not be a barrier. With this in mind, 
            a scholarship program is presently available for Therapeutic Riding / Driving and Summer Camp programs. 
            Participants (or their parents / caregivers) who require financial assistance with program fees can complete a confidential Scholarship Application Form. Each applicant family is asked to “pay what they can” in order to stretch scholarship donations to benefit as many participants as possible. Each approved application is matched to a designated Scholarship Fund donation. If there are not sufficient funds available, we can provide information to parents about potential alternate sources. If you are interested in supporting or applying to our Scholarship Program, 
            please contact Lynne O’Brien, Executive Director at 519-837-0558, ext. 31 or <a href="mailto:lynne@sunrise-therapeutic.ca">lynne@sunrise-therapeutic.ca</a>.<br> Click here to download the <a href="uploads/scholarship-application-form-Fillable-PDF.pdf">Scholarships Application Form</a>.</p>
